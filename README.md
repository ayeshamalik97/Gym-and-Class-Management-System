# Gym-and-Class-Management-System
The Gym and Class Management system is designed to streamline gym operations by organizing members information, managing classes , schedule, assigning trainers and maintaining equipment records. This system will track membership, attendance and trainer assignments, allowing for efficient management of gym activities and resources.

Database Planning:
The planning process for the database involves identifying the core entities and their
relationships. For this project, we focused on entities such as members, instructors, classes,
equipment, schedules, and attendance. Planning included deciding what data each entity should
store and how they interact with each other. The main goal is to create an efficient structure
that supports class management, attendance tracking, and equipment monitoring.

Mission Statement & Objectives

  System Definition
  
Scope:
This system is designed for gym owners and staff to manage day-to-day operations like
member registrations, class schedules, instructor profiles, and equipment inventory. It allows
tracking member attendance and analysing class popularity, helping gym managers optimize
their resources. Future expansions include fitness progress tracking and reminder notifications
for members.
Purpose:
To centralize and streamline gym operations, reducing manual workload and providing
valuable insights through class popularity data, member activity tracking, and equipment
management.

Requirement Collection and Analysis

Requirement-Gathering:
For this project, requirements were collected through interviews with gym managers and
instructors and surveys completed by members. During interviews, gym managers highlighted
a growing need for automated scheduling and attendance tracking, particularly as membership
numbers increase. This reflects the wider trend among gyms in Pakistan and globally, where
digital systems are increasingly essential for managing large customer bases. A study from the
International Health, Racquet & Sports club Association (IHRSA) shows that fitness facilities
worldwide are adopting similar digital solutions to improve member experience and
operational efficiency.
In Pakistan, gym owners often find it challenging to maintain equipment inventories and track
class popularity manually. To address this, features like equipment inventory management and
analytics for class popularity were prioritized, allowing gyms to identify popular classes and
optimize resources. This aligns with a survey by the Pakistan Fitness Federation (PFF), which
indicated that many gym owners seek automated systems to better manage high-demand
classes and monitor equipment usage.

Analysis:
The data collected was analysed to prioritize the main features of the system, including member
profile management, class schedules, attendance, and equipment inventory. Insights gained
from gym managers showed a high demand for fitness progress tracking and class reminders
to keep members engaged and consistent in their attendance. Worldwide, gyms that use similar
features have reported increased customer satisfaction and retention, as digital tracking helps
members monitor their fitness journey and stay motivated.
